                    <p>Dr. Atkins acted as an optometrist for the people of Dallas for fifteen years before 
                    deciding that he needed a change of pace. Having heard many good things about the 
                    beautiful country and welcoming people of Black Forest, he closed his Dallas office. 
                    Finding an office for rent in Black Forest's city center, he plans to open his new 
                    location within the next three months. He knows that he is comin to Black Forest as an 
                    unknown, and will need the support of the local Chamber of Commerce to help spread word 
                    of mouth and bring in new clients.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Atkins wants:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> help getting word of mouth out about his new practice.</li>
                        <li> to be kept aware of future and potential events that might affect his business and the community.</li>
                        <li> a voice in what happens to his local community, including future businesses and developments.</li>

                    <p>James Morris, 'Jimmy' to his friends, has lived in Black Forest his entire life. Always good
                    with his hands, he was well-known in high school for his beautiful woodworking projects. After 
                    years of supplementing his income with projects sold through online retailers, he finally has the
                    confidence to commit to a brick and mortar store. Having secured a business loan, he is hoping to
                    find a new location to set up shop, and to get the help of the local community in supporting his new 
                    venture.</p>
                    <p>Jimmy wants:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> help navigating the paperwork involved in transitioning his business to a brick and mortar location.</li>
                        <li> understanding the laws and taxes that will affect him as the owner of a physical store.</li>
                        <li> to help plan and participate in community events and activities.</li>
