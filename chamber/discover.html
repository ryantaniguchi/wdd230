            <p>Black Forest is a community with history. Founded in 1853, Black Forest has grown to become one of Colorado's largest and most premier cities. But we are also a 
                city in growth, that is focused on providing for the needs of our growing population. We know that, with over 21% of our population being under 18 as of 2020, the 
                children of Black Forest are our future.
